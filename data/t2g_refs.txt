        * "To curate variants, automated curation tools use expression patterns such as annotation of variants, contextual features, distance-metrics, graph-metrics, and rule-based systems such as pattern matching. For example, two common tools MEMA and MuteXt have been developed that can use a dictionary search for protein and gene names and differentiate protein names based on the measurement of word proximity distance for extraction of variants: a variant in a paper is closer to the names of its related genes/proteins rather than names of other proteins/genes that are also present in the paper [16], [22]"
